# plp_project

Hello,

No additional requirments other that the latest Django in your project environment.

The project is an online information center for plp members.
this is where admins can post updates and news in regards to a program.

Having an information center would help save time on getting information rather than going through threads and message groups on mobile apps.
Information such as members of a group, notes location and deadlines were hard to get due to lack of proper communcation.
